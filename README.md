Web Developmet 2 Assignment

I used Webstorm for the code and sourcetree to push to Github.

I also uploaded a video in youtube. URL: 

The weather top app requires a log in to function.

You can sign up by pressing the signup button which brings you to the sign up page.

This is the preset log in details: user email: homer@simpson.com password: secret

You can add or delete stations on the main dashboard. The main dashboard displays the current condition per station. When adding a Station, you can also input the location (latitude ang Longitude) and it will also show on the map.

Clicking the blue folder icon will open up the Readings page. Clicking the red bin icon will delete the stations and its readings.

In the Readings Page, the dashboard will present the latest readings available.

The first card is the Station name and the location. This displays the Latitude and Longitude.

The second card is the weather condition. The icon changes depending on the weather code entered.

The third card is the Temperature which displays the Celcius and Fahrenhet readings. The minimum and maximum temperature in celcius is also displayed.

The fourth card is the Wind. This shows the wind based on the Beaufort scale and Label. There is also a compass reading for the wind direction and a min/max value for the wind speed in km/hr. The wind chill is also displayed.

The last card is the Pressure which shows the pressure reading in hpa as well as the min/max pressure.

Red arrow icon for the uptrend and blue down icon for the downtrend.

The reading page also lists the readings entered. It is presented on a table with a Date/Time, Code(weather), wind speed, wind direction and Pressure.

You can add readings. The Date/time form is filled up with the current date/time. You can edit this if needed.

When adding a Reading the current time and date will be prefilled on the Date/time form.

The weather codes can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions

The Temprature will take in a celcius value and display it in both Celcius and Fahrenheit.

The Wind Speed take in a km/hr value and converts it to the Beaufort scale and label.

The Wind direction takes in a degrees reading from 0-360 and converts then to compass direction.

The Pressure will accept a hpa reading.

You can delete a reading by pressing the red bin icon.

The Trend charts shows the temperature and Windspeed one the same chart (red= temp, green= windspeed), I used a bar chart for the pressure readings for diversity.

There is a functioning Auto Generate Reading which uses the Openweather API current readings

This is a partially completed Release 3 version. I have completed all the required items except for the Release 3- user can edit their personal details.-->I had made a form based on the sign up but I was not able to develop a working code to make it work.
